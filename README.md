# Hello World with React boilerplate
<p>
  <a href="https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello.git"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello/master/open-in-gitpod.svg?sanitize=true" />

This template is similar to create-react-app but it's meant for 4Geeks Academy students.

##### Download the boilerplate using git

```
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello.git
$ cd react-hello
```

##### and install the npm package:
```
$ npm install
```

## My First website!

For Windows, Mac, Linux or Gitpod, start the webpack server with live reload:
- `$ npm run start`

This is a first website made with React using Components.

## Other features

- Automatic Code Formatting: Use of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for automatic code indentation and formatting.
- Error reporting: Use of [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for better error reporting.
- Hot Deploy: Use of [Webpack Development Server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) for hot deploy and live reload.
- One-command publish of the code to github pages with `npm run deploy:github`.
- Babel 7 (really fast).
